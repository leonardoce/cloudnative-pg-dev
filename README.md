# CloudNativePG development environment

This is the flake I use to quickly create a dev shell for
[CloudNativePG](github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg).

I think this is the fastest way to get a development environment as quickly as
possible.

Want to give it a try?

Install [Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install), and give a read to [this
Nix tutorial](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/nix-develop). Then:

```
nix develop github:leonardoce/cloudnative-pg-dev
```
